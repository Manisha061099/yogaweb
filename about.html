    <div class="about"> 
        
        The ultimate goals of yoga are stilling the mind and gaining insight, resting in detached awareness, and
        liberation (Moksha) from saṃsāra and duḥkha: a process (or discipline) leading to unity (Aikyam) with the divine
        (Brahman) or with one's Self (Ātman).[57] This goal varies by philosophical or theological system. In the
        classical Astanga yoga system, the ultimate goal of yoga is to achieve samadhi and remain in that state as pure
        awareness.

        According to Knut A. Jacobsen, yoga has five principal meanings:[58]

        A disciplined method for attaining a goal
        Techniques of controlling the body and mind
        A name of a school or system of philosophy (darśana)
        With prefixes such as "hatha-, mantra-, and laya-, traditions specialising in particular yoga techniques
        The goal of Yoga practice[59]
        David Gordon White writes that yoga's core principles were more or less in place in the 5th century CE, and
        variations of the principles developed over time:[60]

        A meditative means of discovering dysfunctional perception and cognition, as well as overcoming it to release
        any suffering, find inner peace, and salvation. Illustration of this principle is found in Hindu texts such as
        the Bhagavad Gita and Yogasutras, in a number of Buddhist Mahāyāna works, as well as Jain texts.[61]
        The raising and expansion of consciousness from oneself to being coextensive with everyone and everything. These
        are discussed in sources such as in Hinduism Vedic literature and its epic Mahābhārata, the Jain
        Praśamaratiprakarana, and Buddhist Nikaya texts.[62]
        A path to omniscience and enlightened consciousness enabling one to comprehend the impermanent (illusive,
        delusive) and permanent (true, transcendent) reality. Examples of this are found in Hinduism Nyaya and Vaisesika
        school texts as well as Buddhism Mādhyamaka texts, but in different ways.[63]
        A technique for entering into other bodies, generating multiple bodies, and the attainment of other supernatural
        accomplishments. These are, states White, described in Tantric literature of Hinduism and Buddhism, as well as
        the Buddhist Sāmaññaphalasutta.[64] James Mallinson, however, disagrees and suggests that such fringe practices
        are far removed from the mainstream Yoga's goal as meditation-driven means to liberation in Indian
        religions.[65]
        According to White, the last principle relates to legendary goals of yoga practice; it differs from yoga's
        practical goals in South Asian thought and practice since the beginning of the Common Era in Hindu, Buddhist,
        and Jain philosophical schools.[66]
