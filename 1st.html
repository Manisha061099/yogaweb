                <h2>ABOUT YOGA </h2>
                <p>LYoga (/ˈjoʊɡə/ (listen);[1] Sanskrit: योग, lit. 'yoke' or 'union' pronounced [joːɡɐ]) is a group of
                    physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India and aim
                    to control (yoke) and still the mind, recognizing a detached witness-consciousness untouched by the
                    mind (Chitta) and mundane suffering (Duḥkha). There is a wide variety of schools of yoga, practices,
                    and goals[2] in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism,[3][4][5] and traditional and modern yoga is
                    practiced worldwide.[6]

                    Two general theories exist on the origins of yoga. The linear model holds that yoga originated in
                    the Vedic period, as reflected in the Vedic textual corpus, and influenced Buddhism; according to
                    author Edward Fitzpatrick Crangle, this model is mainly supported by Hindu scholars. According to
                    the synthesis model, yoga is a synthesis of non-Vedic and Vedic elements; this model is favoured in
                    Western scholarship.[7][8]

                    Yoga-like practices are first mentioned in the Rigveda.[9] Yoga is referred to in a number of the
                    Upanishads.[10][11][12] The first known appearance of the word "yoga" with the same meaning as the
                    modern term is in the Katha Upanishad,[13][14] which was probably composed between the fifth and
                    third centuries BCE.[15][16] Yoga continued to develop as a systematic study and practice during the
                    fifth and sixth centuries BCE in ancient India's ascetic and Śramaṇa movements.[17] The most
                    comprehensive text on Yoga, the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, date to the early centuries of the Common
                    Era;[18][19][note 1] Yoga philosophy became known as one of the six orthodox philosophical schools
                    (Darśanas) of Hinduism in the second half of the first millennium CE.[20][web 1] Hatha yoga texts
                    began to emerge between the ninth and 11th centuries, originating in tantra.[21][22]

                    The term "yoga" in the Western world often denotes a modern form of Hatha yoga and a posture-based
                    physical fitness, stress-relief and relaxation technique,[23] consisting largely of asanas;[24] this
                    differs from traditional yoga, which focuses on meditation and release from worldly
                    attachments.[23][25] It was introduced by gurus from India after the success of Swami Vivekananda's
                    adaptation of yoga without asanas in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[26] Vivekananda
                    introduced the Yoga Sutras to the West, and they became prominent after the 20th-century success of
                    hatha yoga.[27]hlo</p>

                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: larger;">
                    Yoga is an ancient and complex practice, rooted in Indian philosophy. It began as a spiritual
                    practice
                    but has
                    become popular as a way of promoting physical and mental well-being.

                    Although classical yoga also includes other elements, yoga as practiced in the United States
                    typically
                    emphasizes physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation (dyana).

                    There are many different yoga styles, ranging from gentle practices to physically demanding ones.
                    Differences in
                    the types of yoga used in research studies may affect study results. This makes it challenging to
                    evaluate
                    research on the health effects of yoga.

                    Yoga and two practices of Chinese origin—tai chi and qigong—are sometimes called “meditative
                    movement”
                    practices. All three practices include both meditative elements and physical ones.

                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: larger;">

                    Research suggests that yoga may:
                    Help improve general wellness by relieving stress, supporting good health habits, and improving
                    mental/emotional
                    health, sleep, and balance.
                    Relieve low-back pain and neck pain, and possibly pain from tension-type headaches and knee
                    osteoarthritis.
                    Help people who are overweight or obese lose weight.
                    Help people quit smoking.
                    Help people manage anxiety or depressive symptoms associated with difficult life situations.
                    Relieve menopause symptoms.
                    Help people with chronic diseases manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.
                    Although there’s been a lot of research on the health effects of yoga, many studies have included
                    only
                    small
                    numbers of people and haven’t been of high quality. Therefore, in most instances, we can only say
                    that
                    yoga has
                    shown promise for particular health uses, not that it’s been proven to help.

        <h1 style="text-align: center; color: red;">BENEFITS OF YOGA</h1>
        <div id="about" style="text-align: center;">

            The ultimate goals of yoga are stilling the mind and gaining insight, resting in detached awareness, and
            liberation (Moksha) from saṃsāra and duḥkha: a process (or discipline) leading to unity (Aikyam) with the
            divine
            (Brahman) or with one's Self (Ātman).[57] This goal varies by philosophical or theological system. In the
            classical Astanga yoga system, the ultimate goal of yoga is to achieve samadhi and remain in that state as
            pure
            awareness.

            According to Knut A. Jacobsen, yoga has five principal meanings:[58]

            A disciplined method for attaining a goal
            Techniques of controlling the body and mind
            A name of a school or system of philosophy (darśana)
            With prefixes such as "hatha-, mantra-, and laya-, traditions specialising in particular yoga techniques
            The goal of Yoga practice[59]
            David Gordon White writes that yoga's core principles were more or less in place in the 5th century CE, and
            variations of the principles developed over time:[60]

            A meditative means of discovering dysfunctional perception and cognition, as well as overcoming it to
            release
            any suffering, find inner peace, and salvation. Illustration of this principle is found in Hindu texts such
            as
            the Bhagavad Gita and Yogasutras, in a number of Buddhist Mahāyāna works, as well as Jain texts.[61]
            The raising and expansion of consciousness from oneself to being coextensive with everyone and everything.
            These
            are discussed in sources such as in Hinduism Vedic literature and its epic Mahābhārata, the Jain
            Praśamaratiprakarana, and Buddhist Nikaya texts.[62]
            A path to omniscience and enlightened consciousness enabling one to comprehend the impermanent (illusive,
            delusive) and permanent (true, transcendent) reality. Examples of this are found in Hinduism Nyaya and
            Vaisesika
            school texts as well as Buddhism Mādhyamaka texts, but in different ways.[63]
            A technique for entering into other bodies, generating multiple bodies, and the attainment of other
            supernatural
            accomplishments. These are, states White, described in Tantric literature of Hinduism and Buddhism, as well
            as
            the Buddhist Sāmaññaphalasutta.[64] James Mallinson, however, disagrees and suggests that such fringe
            practices
            are far removed from the mainstream Yoga's goal as meditation-driven means to liberation in Indian
            religions.[65]
            According to White, the last principle relates to legendary goals of yoga practice; it differs from yoga's
            practical goals in South Asian thought and practice since the beginning of the Common Era in Hindu,
            Buddhist,
            and Jain philosophical schools.[66]

        <h1>RREGULATING YOUR BREATH – THE YOGA WAY</h1>

        The most simple breathing exercise for calming both the nervous system and the overworked mind is a timed way of
        breathing where the exhalation is longer than the inhalation. This reduces the tone of your sympathetic nervous
        system (fight or flight response) while activating your parasympathetic nervous system (the rest, relax, and
        digest response). Breathing in this way for at least five minutes will bring about a difference in your overall
        mood. Anyone can do this exercise without having to consult a teacher.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>Pranayama Techniques</h1> <br>

        In addition to the practice of simple deep breathing, ancient yogis have detailed different types of rhythmic
        deep breathing techniques that can have differing effects on the mind and body. Each of these breathing
        techniques has specific effects on the mind-body continuum.

        Please keep in mind that you should learn the following breathing techniques from a qualified teacher who will
        also be able to guide you when to practice, how many times and over what period of time. In the Hatha Yoga
        Pradipika, one of the oldest texts on Hatha yoga, it is said that: “All diseases are eradicated by the proper
        practice of pranayama. All diseases can arise through improper practice. The lungs heart and nerves are normally
        strong and gain strength with regulated and suitable pranayama, but weakened with improper practice. By wrong
        and excessive practice one’s mental quirks and even nervous tics could become exaggerated. Every practice should
        be treated with respect and caution. Hence guidance is to be sought.

        The Yoga Chudamani Upanishad states: “Just as the lion, elephant and tiger are brought under control slowly and
        steadily, similarly the PRANA should be controlled, otherwise it becomes destructive to the practitioner.

        <h1>1. Nadi Shodhana or Alternate Nostril Breathing</h1>

        A yogic practice that immediately helps you to feel calmer whenever you are feeling anxious or agitated.

        Inhale deeply through your left nostril while holding your right nostril closed with your right thumb. At its
        culmination, switch nostrils by closing off your left nostril and continuing to exhale smoothly through your
        right nostril. After exhaling fully, proceed to inhale through the right nostril, again closing it off at the
        peak of your inhalation. Lift your finger off the left nostril and exhale fully. Continue alternating your
        breathing through each nostril and practice for 3 to 5 minutes. Ensure that your breathing is effortless, and
        your mind gently focusing on the inflow and outflow of breath. The above description is a beginner’s version of
        alternate nostril breathing. More advanced versions include regulated breathing on a certain count for
        inhalation and exhalation as well as breath retention. The Rajadhiraja system of pranayama is a highly advanced
        practice, which combines alternate nostril breathing with focus on a certain chakra while repeating a mantra. It
        is only taught individually, hence for those interested to learn more please email us.

        <h1> 2. Ujjayi or Ocean’s Breath</h1>

        A cooling pranayama that can help soothe and settle your mind when you feel irritated, frustrated or angry.

        Inhale slightly deeper than normal. Exhale through your nose with your mouth closed and constricting your throat
        muscles. If done correctly, this should sound like waves on the ocean. You can also try this practice by
        exhaling with your mouth open and making the sound “haaaaah”. Try to make a similar sound with your mouth
        closed, with the outflow of air through your nasal passages. With some practice, you should then use the same
        method while inhaling, gently constricting your throat as you inhale. Even though Ujjayi can be practiced once
        in a while as described above, daily Ujjayi must be prescribed by a teacher, and is given when the Sushumna
        nadii is sufficiently cleared, hence the need to practice under the guidance of a teacher. It is calming, but
        has a heating effect, stimulating the process of oxidation. It is contraindicated for low blood pressure.

        The Pranayama techniques of deep breathing listed above are geared to improving the levels of energy in the
        body. Through regular practice, you will soon start to breathe more effectively without making any conscious
        effort.

        <h1>3. Shiitali Kumbhaka or the cooling breath</h1>

        Fold your tongue lengthwise and inhale deeply through the fold. Close your mouth, hold the breath on a count of
        eight and then exhale through the nose. Continue for a eight breaths, sustain for a maximum of eight minutes.
        Thereafter you massage the diseased are of the body (as prescribed in yoga therapy). Benefits of this method
        include reduced pitta (heat) in the regions of head, neck, and upper digestive tract. It is contraindicated in
        case of asthma, bronchitis and chronic constipation.

        <h1>4. Siitkari Kumbhaka or the hissing breath</h1>

        This practice has the same basic effects as the shiitali method. Inhale through the nose, hold your breath for
        eight seconds and exhale through the mouth, while resting your teeth on your tongue and producing the sound
        s-s-s with your tongue. In addition to reduced pitta, benefits include purification of the senses. The
        contraindications are the same as for shiitali.

        The practice of Shiitali and Siitkari are to be avoided for a period of one hour before and after the practice
        of pranayama connected with one’s meditation. In general it is best to only practice one pranayama technique at
        a time.

        <h1>5. Brahmari or the humming breath</h1>

        The inhalation is similar to the ujjayi (detailed above) and during exhalation one has to hum like a bee. The
        humming results in a resonating vibration in the head and heart. Proceed to take ten deep breaths in this manner
        and then another ten deep Brahmari breaths while closing both ears during the exhale process. This helps to
        notably enhance the resonance effect and resultant benefits. This method helps in balancing vata (circulation or
        flow) in addition to subtly enhancing awareness, both mental and emotional. Additionally, it may be practiced
        together with yoni mudra (as taught by a teacher). Never practice this method while lying on your back. It has
        to be practiced while sitting in upright position.

        <h1> 6. Bhastrika or the bellows breath</h1>

        A word of caution: This exercise must only be performed under supervision. Close the right nostril and inhale
        twenty rapid bellows-like breaths through the left nostril. Repeat with twenty more bellows breaths through the
        right nostril while keeping the left nostril closed. Proceed to take twenty bellows breaths through both
        nostrils. This method helps draw prana (the life force) into the body and mind, thus clearing out mental,
        emotional and physical blocks.

        <h1> 7. Surya Bhedana or the solar breath</h1>

        Similar to the Nadi Shodhana, inhale through the right nostril and exhale through the left. Repeat this for a
        minimum of six breaths and a maximum of ten minutes. Benefits include heating and warming breaths that help
        balance vata in the body. It is contraindicated in case of heart disease, hypertension, epilepsy,
        hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer and acidity.

        <h1>8. Chandra Bhedana or the lunar breath</h1>

        Inhale through the left nostril and exhale through the right for a minimum of six breaths and sustain for a
        maximum of ten minutes. This cooling breath process helps reduce pitta. It should not be practiced by people who
        suffer from depression, who have mental disturbances, excess mucus and a sluggish digestion.

        <h1> 9. Active Yogic Breathing</h1>

        Practice long, slow and deep breaths in and out through the nose as you walk at a moderate pace. Try to extend
        your inhalations and exhalations as you walk. Keep the count of steps during each full inhale and exhale. Aim to
        take ten steps or more for each inhale and exhale. This method works to combine the calming effect of breathing
        with an active lifestyle.

        The process of thinking and emotions are both voluntary and involuntary as is the act of respiration. Pranayama
        (control of the vital life force) can be achieved through the control of the respiration process. Advanced yogic
        breathing practices bring benefits to the various systems of the body, by improving circulation and thus
        enhancing the performance of the various organs.
