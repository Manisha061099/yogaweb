            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: larger;">
                Yoga is an ancient and complex practice, rooted in Indian philosophy. It began as a spiritual practice
                but has
                become popular as a way of promoting physical and mental well-being.

                Although classical yoga also includes other elements, yoga as practiced in the United States typically
                emphasizes physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation (dyana).

                There are many different yoga styles, ranging from gentle practices to physically demanding ones.
                Differences in
                the types of yoga used in research studies may affect study results. This makes it challenging to
                evaluate
                research on the health effects of yoga.

                Yoga and two practices of Chinese origin—tai chi and qigong—are sometimes called “meditative movement”
                practices. All three practices include both meditative elements and physical ones.

            <h2 style="text-align: center;"> What are the health benefits of yoga?</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: larger;">

                Research suggests that yoga may:
                Help improve general wellness by relieving stress, supporting good health habits, and improving
                mental/emotional
                health, sleep, and balance.
                Relieve low-back pain and neck pain, and possibly pain from tension-type headaches and knee
                osteoarthritis.
                Help people who are overweight or obese lose weight.
                Help people quit smoking.
                Help people manage anxiety or depressive symptoms associated with difficult life situations.
                Relieve menopause symptoms.
                Help people with chronic diseases manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.
                Although there’s been a lot of research on the health effects of yoga, many studies have included only
                small
                numbers of people and haven’t been of high quality. Therefore, in most instances, we can only say that
                yoga has
                shown promise for particular health uses, not that it’s been proven to help.
