        <h1>Regulating your Breath – The Yoga Way</h1>

        The most simple breathing exercise for calming both the nervous system and the overworked mind is a timed way of
        breathing where the exhalation is longer than the inhalation. This reduces the tone of your sympathetic nervous
        system (fight or flight response) while activating your parasympathetic nervous system (the rest, relax, and
        digest response). Breathing in this way for at least five minutes will bring about a difference in your overall
        mood. Anyone can do this exercise without having to consult a teacher.

        <h1>Pranayama Techniques</h1>

        In addition to the practice of simple deep breathing, ancient yogis have detailed different types of rhythmic
        deep breathing techniques that can have differing effects on the mind and body. Each of these breathing
        techniques has specific effects on the mind-body continuum.

        Please keep in mind that you should learn the following breathing techniques from a qualified teacher who will
        also be able to guide you when to practice, how many times and over what period of time. In the Hatha Yoga
        Pradipika, one of the oldest texts on Hatha yoga, it is said that: “All diseases are eradicated by the proper
        practice of pranayama. All diseases can arise through improper practice. The lungs heart and nerves are normally
        strong and gain strength with regulated and suitable pranayama, but weakened with improper practice. By wrong
        and excessive practice one’s mental quirks and even nervous tics could become exaggerated. Every practice should
        be treated with respect and caution. Hence guidance is to be sought.

        The Yoga Chudamani Upanishad states: “Just as the lion, elephant and tiger are brought under control slowly and
        steadily, similarly the PRANA should be controlled, otherwise it becomes destructive to the practitioner.

        <h1>1. Nadi Shodhana or Alternate Nostril Breathing</h1>

        A yogic practice that immediately helps you to feel calmer whenever you are feeling anxious or agitated.

        Inhale deeply through your left nostril while holding your right nostril closed with your right thumb. At its
        culmination, switch nostrils by closing off your left nostril and continuing to exhale smoothly through your
        right nostril. After exhaling fully, proceed to inhale through the right nostril, again closing it off at the
        peak of your inhalation. Lift your finger off the left nostril and exhale fully. Continue alternating your
        breathing through each nostril and practice for 3 to 5 minutes. Ensure that your breathing is effortless, and
        your mind gently focusing on the inflow and outflow of breath. The above description is a beginner’s version of
        alternate nostril breathing. More advanced versions include regulated breathing on a certain count for
        inhalation and exhalation as well as breath retention. The Rajadhiraja system of pranayama is a highly advanced
        practice, which combines alternate nostril breathing with focus on a certain chakra while repeating a mantra. It
        is only taught individually, hence for those interested to learn more please email us.

       <h1> 2. Ujjayi or Ocean’s Breath</h1>

        A cooling pranayama that can help soothe and settle your mind when you feel irritated, frustrated or angry.

        Inhale slightly deeper than normal. Exhale through your nose with your mouth closed and constricting your throat
        muscles. If done correctly, this should sound like waves on the ocean. You can also try this practice by
        exhaling with your mouth open and making the sound “haaaaah”. Try to make a similar sound with your mouth
        closed, with the outflow of air through your nasal passages. With some practice, you should then use the same
        method while inhaling, gently constricting your throat as you inhale. Even though Ujjayi can be practiced once
        in a while as described above, daily Ujjayi must be prescribed by a teacher, and is given when the Sushumna
        nadii is sufficiently cleared, hence the need to practice under the guidance of a teacher. It is calming, but
        has a heating effect, stimulating the process of oxidation. It is contraindicated for low blood pressure.

        The Pranayama techniques of deep breathing listed above are geared to improving the levels of energy in the
        body. Through regular practice, you will soon start to breathe more effectively without making any conscious
        effort.

        <h1>3. Shiitali Kumbhaka or the cooling breath</h1>

        Fold your tongue lengthwise and inhale deeply through the fold. Close your mouth, hold the breath on a count of
        eight and then exhale through the nose. Continue for a eight breaths, sustain for a maximum of eight minutes.
        Thereafter you massage the diseased are of the body (as prescribed in yoga therapy). Benefits of this method
        include reduced pitta (heat) in the regions of head, neck, and upper digestive tract. It is contraindicated in
        case of asthma, bronchitis and chronic constipation.

        <h1>4. Siitkari Kumbhaka or the hissing breath</h1>

        This practice has the same basic effects as the shiitali method. Inhale through the nose, hold your breath for
        eight seconds and exhale through the mouth, while resting your teeth on your tongue and producing the sound
        s-s-s with your tongue. In addition to reduced pitta, benefits include purification of the senses. The
        contraindications are the same as for shiitali.

        The practice of Shiitali and Siitkari are to be avoided for a period of one hour before and after the practice
        of pranayama connected with one’s meditation. In general it is best to only practice one pranayama technique at
        a time.

      <h1>5. Brahmari or the humming breath</h1>

        The inhalation is similar to the ujjayi (detailed above) and during exhalation one has to hum like a bee. The
        humming results in a resonating vibration in the head and heart. Proceed to take ten deep breaths in this manner
        and then another ten deep Brahmari breaths while closing both ears during the exhale process. This helps to
        notably enhance the resonance effect and resultant benefits. This method helps in balancing vata (circulation or
        flow) in addition to subtly enhancing awareness, both mental and emotional. Additionally, it may be practiced
        together with yoni mudra (as taught by a teacher). Never practice this method while lying on your back. It has
        to be practiced while sitting in upright position.

       <h1> 6. Bhastrika or the bellows breath</h1>

        A word of caution: This exercise must only be performed under supervision. Close the right nostril and inhale
        twenty rapid bellows-like breaths through the left nostril. Repeat with twenty more bellows breaths through the
        right nostril while keeping the left nostril closed. Proceed to take twenty bellows breaths through both
        nostrils. This method helps draw prana (the life force) into the body and mind, thus clearing out mental,
        emotional and physical blocks.

        <h1> 7. Surya Bhedana or the solar breath</h1>

        Similar to the Nadi Shodhana, inhale through the right nostril and exhale through the left. Repeat this for a
        minimum of six breaths and a maximum of ten minutes. Benefits include heating and warming breaths that help
        balance vata in the body. It is contraindicated in case of heart disease, hypertension, epilepsy,
        hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer and acidity.

        <h1>8. Chandra Bhedana or the lunar breath</h1>

        Inhale through the left nostril and exhale through the right for a minimum of six breaths and sustain for a
        maximum of ten minutes. This cooling breath process helps reduce pitta. It should not be practiced by people who
        suffer from depression, who have mental disturbances, excess mucus and a sluggish digestion.

       <h1> 9. Active Yogic Breathing</h1>

        Practice long, slow and deep breaths in and out through the nose as you walk at a moderate pace. Try to extend
        your inhalations and exhalations as you walk. Keep the count of steps during each full inhale and exhale. Aim to
        take ten steps or more for each inhale and exhale. This method works to combine the calming effect of breathing
        with an active lifestyle.

        The process of thinking and emotions are both voluntary and involuntary as is the act of respiration. Pranayama
        (control of the vital life force) can be achieved through the control of the respiration process. Advanced yogic
        breathing practices bring benefits to the various systems of the body, by improving circulation and thus
        enhancing the performance of the various organs.
